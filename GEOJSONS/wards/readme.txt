Only Lung cancer is present, just as an example of how the data has been structured.
If I were to do it again I 'd separate geometry data and actual data, would not have everything 
in the same file as it is a bit of a waste of space. Using D3 you can easilly join different
datasets to a GeoJSON or TopoJson.
