in the OSM folder. The conversion from .SHP to .OSM has been carried out using the shp2osm python script.

The GEOJSON folder is where county and wards data are stored in the form of GeoJSON and TopoJSON.

The  environmental/EHA folder contains file specfic to the platform section dealing with Environment agents.
